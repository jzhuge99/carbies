## Overview
### Description
App for user's to track their daily/monthly/yearly carbon footprint relating to what modes of transportation they use per day. Users will enter in where they travel and how they travel, and at the end of the day, receive a rating determing how "eco-friendly" they were to the earth that day. :)

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile**: The app being mobile makes it easy to log modes of transportation and keep track of their daily carbon footprint
- **Story:** We care about the earth, and we hope that this app inspires people to be more aware and concious about their daily carbon footprint. We want this app to be as simple and user friendly as possible, so even the laziest people can use it easily. 
- **Market:** For everyone that cares about the future of Mother Nature
- **Habit:** This app should be used daily, if not hourly. Push notifications will remind users to always be aware of their carbon footprint
- **Scope:** V1 would allow users to be able to track their carbon footprint (in terms of transportation) daily. V2 allow users their personal monthly/yearly progress. V3 would have recommendations to users if yheir carbon footprint is too large. V4 would enable users to share with friends through other means of social media.
